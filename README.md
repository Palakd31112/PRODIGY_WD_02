Creating a compelling landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves several key features to capture attention, convey a clear message, and drive user actions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the essential features and elements you might consider including:

1. Hero Section
Headline: A prominent, engaging headline that clearly communicates the main message or value proposition.
Subheadline: A brief, supportive statement that elaborates on the headline.
Call-to-Action (CTA): A prominent button or link encouraging users to take action (e.g., "Sign Up", "Learn More", "Get Started").
Background Image/Video: An eye-catching background image or video that complements the message.
2. Navigation Bar
Logo: Positioned prominently, typically in the top-left corner.
Menu Items: Links to key sections of the page (e.g., About, Features, Pricing, Contact).
Sticky Navigation: Optionally, make the navigation bar sticky so it stays visible as users scroll.
